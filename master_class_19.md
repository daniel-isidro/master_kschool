### Multiple linear regression equation

* When solving the multiple linear regression equation, in the X matrix, we always have to use a column of 1s to get the \beta_0 regression coefficient (Y-axis crossing point)

* In multiple linear regression, collinearity is also something to avoid

* In MLR, the validity of the adjusted model is used through the adjusted R-squared (in simple LR it was R-squared)

* When using train and test datasets, the test dataset cannot be used in the validation part of the training. Else it would influence the model
