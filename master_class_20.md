# Supervised Learning - Generalized Linear Models
## Mario Encinar, PhD, Mapfre

### Recap: Validating models

* In Linear Regression, Generalized Linear Models, Advanced Regression: with error factors
* With Machine Learning: with cross-validation

### Recap: LR Objective

* Minimizing the loss function. We can get exact coefficients for the loss function
* Optimization of the objective function: basic algorithm - gradient descent

### GLMs

* Can be applied to regression problems and also to classification problems
* In GLMs you have to choose a distribution to explain the model
