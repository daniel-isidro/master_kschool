## Introducción a R

## Fátima Sánchez-Cabo, CNIC

R is an interpreted language, no need to be compiled

**Strong points**
* Good visualizations with almost no effort
* Interactive, output obtained as you code

**First steps in R**

Always setup first the current working directory:

R Studio > Menu Bar > Session > Set Working Directory > Choose Directory

Instead of using the onsole, write everything on a R script (+ button in the top-left area, or File > New R Script)

To execute commands in the R script:

1. Copy/paste it on the console
2. Go to the end of the code and press CTRL + ENTER
3. Click 'Run'

**Environment** is where the created objects appear

**History** is the list of all commands executed

**UP arrow** in the console for going back in the command history

**Assign values to objects:** precio<-871*1.21

**Objects** can be numbers, characters, or logic (TRUE/FALSE)

(Objects can also be assigned values in the way v3="Hola", but it's not preferred)

**ESC key** for interrupting the output in the console
