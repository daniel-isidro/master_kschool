# Master Class 01: Github

## TFM

Between 50 h and 80 h for the TFM

There will be a tutoring class at 2/3 of the beginning of the master for setting up the TFM

10h of classes + 10h of work at home (recommended)

Use Github as a data repository for the notes at the classes. Do a lot of commits so you show your thinking process 

For the mid-course challenge, use Github with a lot of commits. You will have to backpedal on the challenge and you need to show it


## Intro to Github

	mkdir
	ls
	pwd (print working directory)
	cd
	cd ..
	echo “text” > archive.md
	> (put into archive)
	cat FILE.txt (show contents of archive)
	git init (make current folder local repository)

	git add README.md
	git commit -m “comment”
	git push origin master

	git remote add origin https://github.com/daniel-isidro/master_kschool_tst.git

	*.md (markdown file)

Try to avoid merge conflict errors that add "<<<<<HEAD" to the code and make it not compile

## Git best practices

Every week share notes of that week at the Masters on Github to create portfolio

Don’t publish projects with low number of commits. Means there is no progress and you may have copied the code

Better to link Github account with LinkedIn to showcase the portfolio

When working in a working group, every day first thing in the morning do a PULL to receive the freshest code. At the last moment do PUSH

Do not do COMMITS of big files. This way debugging is easier, as looking for bugs is easier when looking at smaller changes

Git basic commands:

	clone
	init
	status
	diff
	add
	commit
	push
	pull
