* FIRST STEP WORKING WITH DATA IS GETTING A DESCRIPTION OF THE DATASET. This is because on symmetrical distributions, mean equals median equals mode. But on the rest of distributions, like long queue distributions, they vary wildly.

* Standard deviation (square root of variance) is used to compare the variance to the mean of a distribution.
