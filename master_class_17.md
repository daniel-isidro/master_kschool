# Statistics and Probability with R

* FIRST STEP WORKING WITH DATA IS GETTING A DESCRIPTION OF THE DATASET. This is because on symmetrical distributions, mean equals median equals mode. But on the rest of distributions, like long queue distributions, they vary wildly.

* Standard deviation (square root of variance) is used to compare the variance to the mean of a distribution.

* In linear regressions, variables have to be on the same scale, we have to standardize them using typification. This is used a lot in ML, supervised learning. Standardize all variables is recommended by Miguel Ángel

* When doing typification, you have to take into account the subgroups of the data, or else you will destroy valuable information (for example, differences in the iris database in R for the 3 species of flowers)
