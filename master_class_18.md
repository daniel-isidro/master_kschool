* Inference (in Statistics) = Predictive ability (ML)

* Statistics are based on Mathematics, ML is based on algorithms

* ML is searching for the optimized relation between variables

* **Applied Data Science** means using the algorithms withouth fully understanding them

* Machine learning engineering goes deeper in the algorith3ms

### Supervised Learning
* x,y

### Regression
* y cont
