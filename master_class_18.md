# Supervised learning - Linear regression

* Inference (in Statistics) = Predictive ability (ML)

* Statistics is based on Mathematics, ML is based on algorithms

* ML is searching for the optimized relation between variables

* **Applied Data Science** means using the algorithms withouth fully understanding them

* Machine learning engineering goes deeper in the algorithms

x,y

### Machine learning - Supervised Learning - Regression
y continuous

### Machine learning - Supervised Learning - Classification
y discrete

### R vs python

SAS is very efficient in data processing, but not good on ML

* R is better in lm, glm, though it also covers ML (decission trees, random forests, gradient boosting)

* python is better in ML (decission trees, random forests, gradient boosting, support-vector machine)
