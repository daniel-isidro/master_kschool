# Supervised learning - Linear regression
## Mario Encinar, PhD - Mapfre

* Inference (in Statistics) = Predictive ability (ML)

* Statistics is based on Mathematics, ML is based on algorithms

* ML is searching for the optimized relation between variables

* **Applied Data Science** means using the algorithms withouth fully understanding them

* Machine learning engineering goes deeper in the algorithms

x,y

### Machine learning - Supervised Learning - Regression
y continuous

### Machine learning - Supervised Learning - Classification
y discrete

### R vs python

SAS is very efficient in data processing, but not good on ML

* R is better in lm, glm, though it also covers ML (decission trees, random forests, gradient boosting)

* python is better in ML (decission trees, random forests, gradient boosting, support-vector machine)

### Data Science phases

1. Data extraction + preprocessing (SQL, Hive, Joints...) (maybe done by Data Engineers)

2. Descriptive analysis, exploratory analysis, diagnostic analysis

3. Predictive analysis, prescriptive analysis

4. Production model (maybe done by Data Engineers)

### Linear regression

* Regression problems consist on exploring datasets, introducing a new variable, and predicting the outcome

* Exploratory analysis consist in looking at scatterplots or histograms and predicting the correlation between vars

* Errors have mean=0, var=constant, normal distribution, and are not dependant on the input variabless
