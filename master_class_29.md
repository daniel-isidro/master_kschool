* **Transfer Learning** Knowledge acquired during model training can be transferred to other models.

* **2 tasks in NLP:** Natural language understanding (NLU) and Natural language generation (NLG).

* Graphs are used to represent the dependencies between the words in a text when doing NLP.

* Stop words were usually removed from texts in NLP (preposiciones, conjunciones, determinantes). Not anymore in modern techniques.

* With ```scikit.learn``` we can give weight to the words so stop words don't have more importance for being more frequent in texts.
