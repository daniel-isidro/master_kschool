# Intro to Recommendation Engines

## Juan Ar√©valo, Cepsa

### Off Topic on Deep Learning

* Recommended reading: Judea Pearl, "The book of why". He is credited for developing a theory of causal and counterfactual inference based on structural models. He introduces "what-if" questions, what would had happened if we had introduced a different input variable. He does it with "Do-calculus".

### Interpretability vs Explainability

* Interpretability means knowing the mathematical equations under the models. 

* Explainability means knowing that certain inputs will lead to certain outputs, and what the most influential input variables are. Human Machine Interfaces study explainability.

### Metrics

* ```recall@n``` does not consider the order of the items. ```map@n``` does
